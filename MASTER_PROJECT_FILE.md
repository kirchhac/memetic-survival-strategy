## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Priority 1: Literature Review
- [ ] Complete archaeoastronomy literature review
- [ ] Identify key archaeological sites for investigation
- [ ] Compile predictive processing research

### Priority 2: Expert Network
- [ ] Create expert contact list (target: 10-15 experts)
- [ ] Develop contact protocols and templates
- [ ] Begin outreach to top 5 experts

### Priority 3: Research System
- [ ] Set up citation management system
- [ ] Establish research protocols
- [ ] Create evidence collection templates

## Key Research Questions (Current Focus)

### Primary Questions
1. **When did the ecliptic vs. equatorial divergence occur?**
   - Need: Pre-3000 BCE astronomical evidence
   - Impact: Establish timeline of divergence

2. **How did agricultural entropy correlate with astronomical choice?**
   - Need: Climate and crop yield data
   - Impact: Test correlation strength

3. **What caused religious system differences?**
   - Need: Causation vs. correlation evidence
   - Impact: Strengthen hypothesis validity

### Secondary Questions
4. **How did calendar systems evolve?**
5. **What explains the Indian synthesis?**
6. **How do modern systems reflect ancient patterns?**

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Expert Availability**: Key experts may not be available
   - **Mitigation**: Build multiple expert contacts per field

2. **Evidence Gaps**: Critical evidence may be missing
   - **Mitigation**: Develop multiple lines of evidence

3. **Timeline Compression**: Research may take longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize core hypothesis testing

### Medium Risk Areas
4. **Publication Challenges**: Academic publishers may be hesitant
   - **Mitigation**: Target specialized publishers, build peer review network

5. **Cultural Transmission**: May be difficult to distinguish from environmental determinism
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on independent development evidence
