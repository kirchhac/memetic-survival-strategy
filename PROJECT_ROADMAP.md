## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Expert Availability**: Key experts may not be available for consultation
   - **Mitigation**: Build multiple expert contacts per field, offer co-authorship opportunities

2. **Evidence Gaps**: Critical evidence may be missing or inaccessible
   - **Mitigation**: Develop multiple lines of evidence, focus on strongest available data

3. **Timeline Compression**: Research may take longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize core hypothesis testing, allow flexibility in content creation

4. **Publication Challenges**: Academic publishers may be hesitant about interdisciplinary work
   - **Mitigation**: Target specialized publishers, prepare strong peer review network

## Success Metrics

### Academic Impact
- [ ] Publication in top-tier academic journal
- [ ] Citation in major academic works within 2 years
- [ ] Invitation to present at major conferences

### Public Impact
- [ ] Book sales targets met
- [ ] Documentary viewership goals achieved
- [ ] Media coverage and public engagement

### Knowledge Advancement
- [ ] New research questions generated
- [ ] Interdisciplinary collaboration fostered
- [ ] Public understanding of science-religion relationship improved
